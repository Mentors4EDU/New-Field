# Proposal for Engineering's New Field
### Quantum Cryptography and its subset Quantum Recursiveness

Quantum Cryptography is a newly emerging field in engineering, with post-quantum crytography algorithms already being processed for standarization. This has "spawned" from Quantum Engineering. However, in this day in age there needs to be a past theoretical approach into looking at post Quantum-level encryption. With Quantum Cryptography, you are making room for Quantum Recursiveness, which something I found interesting was K. Svozil's [Quantum recursion theory](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.263.9717) which he published in 2009.

My intake in Quantum Cryptography, is that we need to go beyond the realm of explaining this in classical terminology. We are talking about a whole new method and apparatus of data processing in general. This is why we need to look into recursive Qubit compatible hardware encryption through pure mathematics, computational physics, and what is possible in the realm of modern day computing.

#### My proposed hashing sequence: 4n!/(2!)^n
##### At N = 0

I am proposing this sequence for the purpose of multi-path layer mathematical recursion/continued hashing for Post-Qauntum networks. Reason (4n) as in representation of the original Qubit encryption layer. Wanted to come up with a new sequence similar to Bernoulli numbers but non-existant.

Proposal OEIS (Pending/Draft): https://oeis.org/A309669

Current Hashing Mathods:

     Lattice-based cryptography
     Multivariate cryptography
     Hash-based cryptography
     Code-based cryptography
     Supersingular elliptic curve isogeny cryptography
     Symmetric key quantum resistance
     
This variation would be Merkle based inspired by my current Hardware cryptography solution for classical computing i.e. HippaSafe2.0 and utilize theoretical hashing. For offset N = -1, you are set with the lowest value of -∞. I wanted to make a non-existant sequence for hashing sort of inspired by Bernoulli numbers.
